# rundeck
An environment to run RUNDECK.

There are 3 containers configured:
- httpd - Apache HTTPD, as a web frontend.
- rundeck - The application.
- mysql - The storage for jobs and job-history. This container will wait until MySQL is available.

To use this "environment" issue:

    git clone https://github.com/robertdebock/rundeck.git
    cd rundeck
    # Edit settings in variables.env to you liking.
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up

This will create a "data" directory to store all persistent data.

When everything has been started (should take some 30 seconds) you can visit
the URL that you've specified in variables.env. You can use these credentials:
- Username: admin
- Password: admin

I've included a few scripts, mostly as a sample:
- add-to-resources.sh - A script to add hosts to rundeck's resources.xml.
- backup.sh - A script to make a backup of all data.
- restore.sh - A script to restore all data.
- list-projects.sh - A script using the API to list projects.
- list-jobs.sh - A script using the API to list jobs in a project.
- execute-jobs.sh - A script using the API to start jobs.

Some scripts contain a key, which you may need to update.

Interesting settings:
- The "web" service is the entrace to this application, and must be listening to a port, you may need to change "ports"
in docker-compose.yml
